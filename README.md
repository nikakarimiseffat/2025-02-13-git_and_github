- `git branch` – Lists all branches in the repository or creates/deletes a branch when used with additional options.

- `git switch` – Switches to a different branch or restores files from a commit.

- `git log --oneline --graph --all` – Displays a concise, graphical representation of the commit history for all branches in a single line per commit.

-  `Branch` – A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main codebase. It starts as a copy of another branch (usually main) and can be modified independently before merging.

- `Pull Request (PR)` – A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically used in collaborative workflows on platforms like GitHub. It allows for code review, discussion, and approval before merging the changes.
